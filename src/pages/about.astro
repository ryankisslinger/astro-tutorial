    <h2>... this is my new astro site!</h2>

    <p>I am working through Astro's intro tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
